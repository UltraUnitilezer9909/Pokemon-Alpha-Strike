# **Story**

In the vast depths of space lies the legendary space station known as "SectoBase 360AV." This station, created by Pokemon scientists, stands as the pinnacle of technological advancement. However, a dark secret hides within its core—a secretive laboratory accessible only to the most brilliant minds. Here, the scientists are developing an artificial Pokemon called the "Xianimon," intended to be a weapon of control and corruption over planet Earth.

One fateful night, as everyone prepares for hibernation, a low-level alarm sounds. Initially dismissed as a routine scientist-related issue, panic ensues when it is announced that there has been a breach near the unstable Xianimon chamber. Scientists rush to stabilize the situation, but time is running out as oxygen levels deplete rapidly. With the chamber on the verge of collapse, one scientist realizes the impending danger and flees before the beast awakens.

Finally, the moment arrives—the Xianimon emerges, a fearsome snake-like creature, taking its first breath. The scientists desperately flee for their lives while setting the alarm to its highest setting. Chaos ensues as the announcement room scientist meets a gruesome end. The beast evolves rapidly, growing stronger with each passing moment, mercilessly hunting down every soul it encounters.

As the Xianimon becomes larger and more powerful, it breaks free from the station, tearing it apart with its newfound ability to fly. Destroying everything in its path, it inadvertently causes a reactor meltdown, resulting in the station's demise. Oxygen levels plummet, leaving little hope for survival. In a final act of bravery, a worker sends a distress signal to a nearby station but succumbs to the lack of oxygen. Meanwhile, the Xianimon escapes, leaving destruction in its wake.

Days pass, and the creature continues to grow, gaining enough power to annihilate an entire planet. Unbeknownst to it, it has journeyed far from its home galaxy, Ahzeos, and now resides on a desolate planet named Areoz. It exhibits intelligence and a destructive nature, fiercely guarding the conditions necessary for life. The Xianimon becomes a mother, producing countless eggs—both her offspring and the foundation for her future fleet. She protects her planet and her brood with unwavering ferocity.

Back on Earth, the Aphexia faction notices the absence of signals from SectoBase 360AV. Intrigued by reports of a breach and the presence of the enigmatic Xianimon, the Secure, Intercept, Attack Government (SIA) launches an investigation. Sending a team to the remnants of SectoBase 360AV's sector, they witness the devastation firsthand. Baffled by the situation, the SIA contacts their Martian counterparts to pool their resources and investigate further.

The investigation team delves deeper into the remnants of SectoBase 360AV's sector, encountering a vast expanse of debris. Among the wreckage, they detect high levels of radioactive waves, particularly concentrated around the site of the reactor explosion. Fortunately, they manage to salvage the main data battery storage, containing crucial information about the station.

Returning to Earth, the team lands at the headquarters of the SIA, eager to uncover the truth. After thorough analysis of the battery's files, they stumble upon a shocking revelation—the existence of a Xianimon-related project known as "Project Xia." It becomes clear that the workers had not only created a monstrous creature with the potential to threaten entire solar systems but had also weaponized it. Even more unsettling is the claim that the Xianimon possesses the ability to transform other Pokemon into Xianimons.

The government is left dumbfounded by these discoveries, as the true orchestrators behind this sinister operation remain a mystery. It appears that those responsible for Project Xia have already met their demise, leaving a trail of destruction and unanswered questions in their wake. The SIA is now faced with the daunting task of devising a plan to neutralize this intergalactic menace and prevent further chaos from unfolding. The legend of SectoBase 360AV and the Xianimon becomes etched in the annals of sci-fi history, a cautionary tale of scientific ambition gone awry, a testament to the consequences of meddling with forces beyond our comprehension.

As the SIA delves deeper into the files, they uncover more terrifying details about the Xianimon. Not only can these creatures transform other Pokemon into Xianimons, but they possess incredible speed, capable of traveling at 80% the speed of light. Their attacks are devastating, and they exhibit resistance to all known Pokemon types. The SIA realizes they are dealing with a formidable war machine, a force that threatens the very fabric of existence.

However, the files offer little information about the appearance of the Xianimon, except for a single mention of their coloration: violet, black, gray, and white. The lack of concrete details intensifies the urgency of the situation, leaving the SIA overwhelmed by the weight of the looming threat.

Unable to handle the crisis alone, the SIA transfers the investigation to the International Intergalactic Neutralizer Corporation (IEN), an organization dedicated to hunting down and protecting the solar system from dangerous entities. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, the IEN focuses its efforts on locating the Xianimon, beginning with the area surrounding SectoBase 360AV and expanding their search into the nearest galaxy.

Deep within the planet Areoz, the snake beast, now known as "Ahrazxia," has evolved both in power and intelligence. She has taken on the role of a mother, nurturing and guiding her offspring. The planet's resources provide sustenance for her growing brood, and she imparts her knowledge, teaching them to fend for themselves and hunt.

Over time, more of Ahrazxia's eggs hatch, and her children, now sentient beings, communicate with each other, developing a complex language akin to that of Pokemon. They construct their own dwellings and cultivate the land, learning to harness the planet's resources to ease their existence. Technological advancements follow suit, with the Xianimon developing devices tailored to their unique needs, further enhancing their civilization.

The Xianimon revere Ahrazxia as their queen, an embodiment of power and wisdom. Together, they form the faction known as the "Xians." Strengthened by unity, they erect formidable defensive systems around their planet, ensuring their safety and autonomy. As their knowledge expands, they master space travel, constructing their own spacecraft. Technological progress surges at an astonishing pace, with the Xians' creations evolving in complexity and sophistication.

Ahrazxia observes her children's growth with a sense of pride, her mind filled with ambitious plans. She envisions expanding their dominion beyond the confines of Areoz, conquering the universe under her command. The stage is set for an epic clash of civilizations, as the Xians prepare to venture forth into the cosmos, their sights firmly set on dominance and the realization of their legendary destiny.

Despite her growing power and ambitions, Ahrazxia chooses not to commence her conquest just yet. She revels in the thrill of her newfound dominance and observes as the hunters from the IEN embark on a relentless search for her throughout the vastness of galaxies.

Ahrazxia understands the importance of patience, biding her time as the hunters traverse the cosmos, driven by a fierce determination to locate and neutralize her. With each passing moment, the legend of Ahrazxia spreads across the stars, captivating the imaginations of those who hear her tale. Her presence becomes a whispered rumor, a cautionary tale of a formidable force waiting in the shadows.

As the hunters face countless challenges and encounter various cosmic wonders during their quest, they remain vigilant, fueled by the knowledge that their mission holds the fate of the universe in balance. Each celestial body they explore and each encounter they face only serves to heighten the anticipation of the inevitable clash between Ahrazxia and those who seek to halt her reign.

After enduring weeks of grueling search efforts, the hunters find themselves disheartened by their lack of progress. Exhausted, they return to the SIA and IEN to regroup, seeking solace on a nearby asteroid. As they catch their breath and replenish their strength, they decide to set up a temporary scanner to continue scanning nearby galaxies and planets.

While enjoying a well-deserved lunch break, the scanner unexpectedly detects anomalous readings originating from a galaxy known as Ahzeos. Intrigued by this unforeseen development, the hunters analyze the data further, pinpointing a particular planet named Areoz as the source of the peculiar energy signatures. Realizing the significance of their discovery, they swiftly relay the information to the SIA and IEN headquarters.

The commanding officers at both organizations recognize the urgency of the situation and issue a direct order: investigate the mysterious planet without delay. With renewed purpose, the hunters embark on a mission that will test their mettle and shape the course of the legendary saga unfolding before them.

Bound by the weight of destiny, the hunters set their course for Areoz, determined to uncover the truth hidden within its enigmatic depths. They brace themselves for the unknown, fully aware that their journey will bring them face to face with the formidable Ahrazxia and her legion of Xians.


With each step closer to their destination, the hunters sense an air of unease enveloping the planet. Their keen eyes discern a peculiar sight—a mysterious space station orbiting Areoz. Strangely, it bears no recognizable insignia of the SIA or IEN but instead features inscriptions in an unfamiliar, cryptic language. A foreboding silence blankets the hunters' ship as its sensors pick up an unusual energy signature emanating from the station, locking onto their vessel like a malevolent gaze.

The ship's radar blares a warning, signaling the presence of imminent threats closing in on their position. Panic seizes the hunters, their hearts pounding with trepidation. Realizing the gravity of the situation, they hastily relay the distress call to both the SIA and IEN, detailing the relentless assault they face at the hands of unknown entities.

Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the hunters and the incoming danger, Ahrazxia continues to devote her time to nurturing and bonding with her offspring. Oblivious to the encroaching conflict, she relishes the joy of motherhood, unaware that the universe around her teeters on the brink of an epic clash.


In a desperate bid for survival, the hunters find themselves locked in a harrowing battle for their lives. With every ounce of strength and determination, they retaliate against their unknown assailants. One among them harnesses a formidable attack, unleashing a torrent of energy upon their adversaries, striking back with unwavering resolve.

However, their defiance is met with a devastating response. The largest of their adversaries charges an overwhelming power beam, its brilliance illuminating the void of space. The beam pierces through the hunters' ship, obliterating it with ruthless efficiency. In an instant, their vessel is reduced to mere specks of stardust, lost to the cosmic expanse.

The SIA and IEN headquarters, monitoring the hunters' progress, suddenly notice the abrupt cessation of their signal in the vicinity of Areoz. Alarm bells ring within their command centers, triggering an urgent response. Recognizing the dire need to investigate and potentially rescue their fallen comrades, a new team is swiftly assembled and dispatched to the treacherous region.

As the new team arrives at the designated coordinates, a sense of anticipation fills the air. The echoes of their fallen comrades' mysterious demise linger in their thoughts, fueling a mixture of trepidation and determination. This time, armed with a heavily fortified vessel, they brace themselves for the unknown that lies ahead.

Hours pass, and the team remains on high alert, their senses heightened to detect any signs of danger. Finally, their persistence pays off as they establish a more sustained presence in the enigmatic region. In awe and disbelief, they transmit their findings back to the SIA and IEN headquarters.

The report paints a picture of a civilization far beyond their own in terms of technological advancement. The creatures dwelling on the planet exhibit a mesmerizing appearance, adorned in hues of violet, black, gray, and white—reminiscent of the descriptions found in the earlier file. The realization strikes the SIA and IEN like a bolt of lightning, connecting the threads of the puzzle that had eluded them for so long.

As news of the impending invasion reaches the other factions, a sense of urgency fills the air. The Aphexia, SIA, and IEN government swiftly mobilize their forces, uniting against the common threat. A fleet of intergalactic vessels, bristling with advanced weaponry, launches towards the embattled planet of Kysdiel.

The journey through the cosmos is fraught with tension, as the allied fleet traverses treacherous asteroid belts and interstellar rifts. Within the confines of their ships, the brave warriors prepare for a battle that will determine the fate of Kysdiel and the entire galaxy.

As they approach the besieged planet, their sensors pick up the immense energy signatures emanating from the war beacon—a testament to the power and ruthlessness of the xianimons. The Aquizia, their forces depleted but their resolve unyielding, await the arrival of their allies.

The battle commences in a dazzling display of lights and explosive force. The allied fleet unleashes a torrent of laser fire, plasma bursts, and energy projectiles upon the invading xianimons. The aquatic creatures of Aquizia, fighting with unwavering determination, join their newfound allies in a desperate struggle to repel the insidious invaders.

The distress signal from the beleaguered planet of Vurolin echoes through the cosmos, alerting the other factions to the imminent threat. The Aphexias receive the distress call and waste no time in responding. Alongside the SIA and IEN, they rally their forces and form a united front against the encroaching darkness.

A fleet of mighty starships, brimming with advanced weaponry and battle-hardened soldiers, hurtles through space towards the fiery surface of Vulcyan. The journey is fraught with danger as they navigate treacherous asteroid fields and evade enemy detection systems.

As they approach the planet, the sight that unfolds before them is one of devastation. The once-vibrant landscape of Vurolin is now marred by the relentless advance of the xianimons. Flames dance across the molten surface, casting an eerie glow upon the ruins of the Vurolins' defenses.

Undeterred by the grim scene, the allied forces launch a coordinated assault. Energy beams streak through the air, missiles arc towards their targets, and the clash of swords and shields reverberates across the desolate landscape. The Vurolins, renowned for their resilience and fierce determination, fight alongside their newfound allies, their spirits unyielding in the face of overwhelming odds.

The battle rages on, each side unleashing their most devastating powers in a desperate bid for victory. The ground shakes as colossal beings clash, their sheer force threatening to tear the planet apart. The skies become a maelstrom of aerial combat, with spacecrafts engaging in breathtaking dogfights amid swirling smoke and debris.

In this crucible of fire and steel, heroes rise to the occasion. Their names will be etched in the annals of galactic history, spoken with reverence and awe. With every swing of their weapons, every blast of their energy, they defy the darkness that seeks to consume their worlds.

In a distant corner of the galaxy, the xianimons set their sights on the serene planet of Gailiax, home to the majestic Galaxias. The Ahpexia, aware of the imminent danger, had already stationed their forces to safeguard the planet. The clash that ensued was nothing short of cataclysmic.

The skies of Gailiax ignited with a fierce celestial dance as the xianimons unleashed their devastating arsenal. Beams of energy pierced through the darkness, leaving trails of destruction in their wake. The Galaxias fought valiantly, their radiant forms blazing with cosmic energy, but the power and relentless advance of the xianimons overwhelmed their defenses.

Wave after wave, the xianimons pressed forward, their determination unyielding. The Ahpexia, renowned for their strategic brilliance, devised daring maneuvers and unleashed their most potent counterattacks. Yet, despite their unwavering resolve, the sheer force of the xianimons was too much to bear.

The planetary defenses crumbled, and the once vibrant landscapes of Gailiax turned into battlegrounds. The Galaxias, renowned for their ethereal beauty and profound wisdom, fought side by side with their Ahpexia allies. Their combined strength was formidable, but even their united might could not halt the relentless onslaught.

As the xianimons ruthlessly expanded their dominion, planet after planet fell under their control. Glaid, home to the ingenious Gladiance and their mastery of radioactive-based technologies, was engulfed in chaos. The once thriving society now lay in ruins, its inhabitants forced to confront the grim reality of their defeat.

Vial, a haven of healing and compassion, stood defenseless against the relentless onslaught. The Creselians, renowned for their profound knowledge of the life force, fought valiantly but were ultimately overwhelmed by the overwhelming power of the xianimons.

Feila, a bustling hub of universal commerce, faced a similar fate. The Oxiance, shrewd traders and innovators, witnessed their vibrant markets turned into battlefields. Their sophisticated technologies proved no match for the destructive might of the invaders.

Even Icia, a distant world known as OGLE-2016-BLG-1190Lb, where the Actilance harnessed the power of cooling to great effect, was unable to withstand the relentless advance of the xianimons. Their once pristine landscapes now echoed with the cries of despair and defiance.

Amidst the chaos and devastation, a glimmer of hope remained—the planet Earth. The last bastion of resistance, guarded by the indomitable Aphexia, stood as the final stronghold against the encroaching darkness. United in purpose and determination, the Aphexia prepared to make their final stand, vowing to protect their home and defend the galaxy from the grip of the xianimons.

As the factions sought refuge on Earth, a unified defense was forged from the amalgamation of their technologies. Combining their knowledge and resources, they fortified their attack and defense systems, enhancing their capabilities to an unprecedented level. Oxiance, renowned for their top-quality products, generously provided their advancements to strengthen the united forces.

Actilance, masters of cooling systems, deployed their most potent technology to fortify Aphexia's defenses. The air crackled with anticipation as the xianimons drew near, their impending arrival heralding a cataclysmic clash of cosmic proportions. Ahrazxia, observing her offspring fulfill their destined role in conquering the universe, awaited the moment of triumph.

As the horde of xianimons advanced, the combined space fleet launched a relentless assault on the war beacon, preventing its landing on Earth and the subsequent opening of a portal for further invasions. Miraculously, they managed to repel the initial wave, buying precious time to prepare for the onslaught yet to come. However, swarms of xianimons from each faction's homelands relentlessly converged on Earth, threatening to overwhelm their defenses.

In the face of this imminent threat, the Aphexias, renowned for their swift research and analytical prowess, embarked on a race against time. Studying every aspect of the xianimons and their technology, they sought to uncover their weaknesses and exploit them to turn the tide of the battle.

Within their secret laboratories, Aphexia's brightest minds delved deep into the enigmatic nature of the xianimons. They deciphered their patterns, analyzed their energy signatures, and unraveled their vulnerabilities. Armed with this newfound knowledge, they devised a daring strategy, a calculated gamble that would determine the fate of not only Earth but the entire universe.

After relentless research, a Pokémon scientist made a breakthrough discovery. They revealed that the colossal "war beacon" deployed by the xianimons during invasions acted as an outpost, serving as a portal directly to their home planet, Areoz. Through this portal, an endless horde of xianimons materialized. To compound the threat, the war beacon possessed an amplification effect, empowering nearby xianimons, making them even more formidable.

Realizing the significance of this revelation, Aphexia and the allied factions devised a daring plan. They recognized that by disabling the war beacons, they could drastically reduce the strength and numbers of the xianimons. With unwavering determination, the factions mobilized their most powerful fleets, each tasked with the perilous mission of taking down the war beacons.

However, as the formidable fleet made its way to confront the war beacons, they encountered fierce resistance from waves of xianimon reinforcements. In a desperate bid to protect the fleets and grant Earth's defenses precious time to upgrade and replenish their ammunition, a valiant defense was mounted.

Explosions lit up the cosmos as the combined forces of the factions clashed with the relentless onslaught of the xianimons. Beams of energy crackled, starships maneuvered with precision, and warriors fought with unyielding resolve. It was a battle of attrition, a struggle that would determine the fate of all life as they knew it.

As the relentless fight raged on, Earth's defenses underwent rapid advancements and resupply. The united factions channeled their collective knowledge and resources, arming themselves with cutting-edge weaponry and reinforced shields. They upgraded their fleets with the latest technology, forged from the combined brilliance of their respective factions.

With each passing day, the resolve of the defenders grew stronger. They honed their tactics, studied the enemy's patterns, and adapted their strategies. Every moment brought them closer to the climactic showdown that would decide the destiny of the universe.

As Ahrazxia observed her struggling offspring on Earth, her maternal instincts kicked in. She laid more eggs, eager to bolster the xianimon forces and turn the tide in their favor. Meanwhile, the powerful fleet made its way through hyperspace, venturing toward Feila, a renowned hub of trade and innovation within the universe. Their mission: to launch a direct assault on the war beacon.

The fleet arrived at Feila and unleashed a concentrated barrage on the war beacon, aiming to disable its sinister influence. However, the xianimons stationed on the planet's surface intercepted the capital ship's attack, prompting the fleet to dispatch ground troops to neutralize the opposition. The initial stages of the operation went according to plan.

But suddenly, a colossal figure emerged from the war beacon's portal, casting an ominous shadow over the battlefield. The massive xianimon cast a piercing gaze at the sky, charging its formidable power. With an earth-shattering burst of energy, the capital ship met its demise in an instant, and the ground troops were effortlessly decimated by the sheer might of the colossal xianimon.

The factions, filled with disappointment and despair, witnessed the devastating outcome. The surviving fleet members, understanding the gravity of the situation, received orders to retreat. They engaged their hyperdrive engines, aiming to escape the pursuing xianimons, who could traverse the cosmos at 80% the speed of light. Amidst their hasty withdrawal, one ship managed to transmit a distress signal, alerting Earth to the impending threat. Tragically, the remaining survivors met their demise before completing their transmission, their vessel transformed into a metallic coffin.

The distress signal reached Earth, conveying the dire news. Multiple war beacon carriers were en route to Earth, bearing the weight of impending doom. The factions on Earth were left reeling from this devastating revelation, their hopes dashed by the colossal xianimon's destruction. Despite their shock, they remained determined to uncover the elusive weakness of the xianimons, channeling their efforts into relentless research and analysis.

As the moment of reckoning approached, the wailing sirens echoed through the air, signaling the impending arrival of the war beacon carrier. Tensions ran high as the defenders prepared for the onslaught. However, fortune favored the defenders as the war beacon carrier and its accompanying war beacon met a swift demise, their destructive potential neutralized before they could unleash chaos upon Earth. The remaining wreckage of the carrier came crashing down, attracting the attention of a group of resilient and resourceful Pokémon.

Seizing the opportunity amidst the chaos, these brave Pokémon ventured to the crash site, where they salvaged the advanced technologies from the downed ship. With their newfound knowledge and equipment, they hastily returned to headquarters, ready to contribute to the ongoing struggle.

In a stroke of fortune, the factions discovered that their previously hidden satellites orbiting their homelands remained functional, evading the prying eyes of the xianimons. The operators in space utilized these satellites to scan the xianimons from their concealed vantage point. The invaluable data gathered allowed the factions to meticulously analyze the xianimons' weaknesses and devise strategic plans for their eventual defeat.

Among the findings, the SIA unearthed a crucial pattern: each war beacon was guarded by towering behemoth-like xianimons. Recognizing the significance of this information, they devised a daring plan to target these colossal adversaries first, understanding that eliminating them would greatly undermine the xianimons' offensive capabilities.

Meanwhile, as fate would have it, another carrier arrived, heralding the arrival of fresh xianimon forces. However, the defenders, emboldened by their recent successes, swiftly intercepted and vanquished the carrier before it could establish a foothold on Earth's soil.

Amidst the ongoing battle, the IEN proposed a daring plan to capture a xianimon for detailed analysis. However, the Actilance faction vehemently opposed the idea, citing the destructive power of their weapons, which could easily annihilate any metal on Earth. The factions opted to wait for the Aphexia's esteemed Pokémon scientists to uncover valuable information that could aid them in their struggle.

Weeks passed, with the defenders tirelessly holding the line against the relentless xianimon onslaught. Suddenly, to everyone's shock, two war beacon carriers emerged on the horizon, their imposing presence casting a shadow of despair. However, amidst this dire situation, the Pokémon scientists made a groundbreaking discovery—a weakness to fire-type Pokémon. Inspired by this revelation, the Vurolins stepped forward, proudly showcasing their formidable arsenal of magma-based weapons and defenses.

As discussions about the xianimons' weakness consumed their attention, an urgent alarm pierced the air, signaling that the defenses could no longer hold their ground. Despite managing to bring down one of the carriers, the other successfully landed on Earth's surface, further exacerbating the sense of impending doom. Planetary defenses crumbled under the relentless assault, and even the defenses in space succumbed to the overwhelming might of the xianimons. The war machine of the xianimons intensified, its power growing with every passing moment, poised to decimate the Pokémon population on Earth.

Left with no other choice, the factions made a heart-wrenching decision to abandon their beloved planet. They sought refuge in SectoBase 040FL, the nearest stronghold, now serving as their temporary headquarters. With heavy hearts, they watched as Earth succumbed to the oppressive control of Ahrazxia, her influence spreading like a suffocating shroud.

As the xianimons continued their relentless invasion of Earth, the factions wasted no time. They harnessed the power of Vurolin's advanced ships, bolstering them with their combined technologies. With newfound determination, they embarked on a swift return to Earth, aiming to reclaim their headquarters.

Amidst the chaotic battle, their united forces tirelessly fought, pushing back the remaining xianimons that had infiltrated the Aphexia's military base. With the enemy eradicated and the defenses swiftly restored, they held their ground, fortifying their headquarters. Every instrument and resource at their disposal was utilized as they hurriedly gathered their forces and made their way back to SectoBase 040FL.

However, the Aphexia faction, driven by their unwavering confidence, sought to make their task seem effortless. They retraced their steps to the place where it all began, SectoBase 360AV. Once there, they meticulously scanned the area, hoping to retrieve any remaining data. Their efforts proved fruitful as they discovered a mysterious blueprint—an enigmatic design devoid of description or name. Recognizing its potential, they set it aside, reserving it for future use.

Meanwhile, the xianimons on Earth continued to grow in strength, overpowering a fleet that had rushed to recover their belongings. Concerned and curious, the factions turned their attention to the enigmatic blueprint. Through careful analysis, they unraveled its secrets. It was a device from Project Xia, specifically designed to counter xianimons in dire circumstances. Realizing that their current situation demanded such measures, they swiftly constructed the device under the guidance of the Elite—the chosen one entrusted with the task of halting the invasion.

United by their common goal of reclaiming their homelands, the factions unleashed their full force against the xianimons. Each faction utilized their unique specialties and expertise to combat the invaders. Determined not to be outdone, they constructed their own war beacons, christened "the Guardians," as a symbol of their resolve to retake what was rightfully theirs.

The fleets defending the designated landing sites eagerly awaited the arrival of the first Guardian. As it descended, the xianimons were taken aback, their confidence momentarily shattered. Swiftly, they rallied their forces and launched a fierce assault, determined to bring down the Guardian before it could fulfill its purpose. Yet, the factions stood tall, filled with pride and conviction, as they fought to protect their creation.

Much to their satisfaction, the Guardian withstood the onslaught, stubbornly resisting the xianimons' advances. And then, true to the legends of old, the Guardian unleashed its true power. Opening a portal to a dimension untouched by the xianimons, it beckoned forth the aid of Latricia, a faction renowned for their spiritual-based technologies. Joy surged through the ranks of the allied factions, their spirits rekindled by this newfound reinforcement. They knew that their cause was not lost, that hope still flickered in the face of adversity.


As the factions of Earth fought valiantly against the xianimons, Ahrazxia, the powerful matriarch of the invaders, observed their resistance with a mix of surprise and disdain. Confident in the strength of her offspring, she dismissed the initial setbacks, believing her children would ultimately overpower their adversaries.

Back on Earth, the tide was turning. The combined might of the eight factions gradually diminished the xianimon forces, eroding their dominance. Yet, a formidable challenge remained—the towering giantic xianimons, their sheer size and power a formidable obstacle. The war beacon they guarded continued to spew forth endless waves of xianimons, posing a persistent threat.

Undeterred, the factions forged an unprecedented alliance, pooling their resources and knowledge. With their collective strength, they mustered the courage to confront and overpower the colossal xianimons. Their coordinated assault proved successful, bringing down the first war beacon and severing the endless flow of invaders.

Ahrazxia, witnessing the triumph of the factions, seethed with anger. Determined to regain control, she ordered her children to harness the very essence of their realm, drawing upon its advanced technologies. Ahrazxia understood that this was only the beginning—a prelude to an even greater clash that would shape the destiny of worlds.

With unwavering determination, the Aphexia faction wasted no time in repairing and reinforcing their fallen defenses. Every turret was meticulously restored, enhanced to reach its maximum potential, and a new turret was constructed at the heart of their headquarters—the legendary Eradicator. Inspired by the enigmatic blueprint discovered in the ruins of SectoBase 360AV, this weapon of immense power stood as a symbol of their resilience.

The Aphexians, driven by their indomitable spirit, embarked on a frenzy of construction. Ships of unparalleled strength and versatility were forged, carriers capable of deploying their formidable forces, and point-defenses that formed an impenetrable shield against the xianimon onslaught. And at the forefront of their fleet, a majestic capital ship emerged—a testament to the combined knowledge and ingenuity of all the factions.

United as a single entity, the factions now embraced their shared identity as "Dragance," a name whispered in awe throughout the universe. The pokemon scientists, fuelled by their passion for discovery and armed with the collective wisdom of their comrades, tirelessly developed powerful weapons specifically tailored to combat the xianimons. Each invention represented a step closer to victory, a testament to their unyielding spirit.

After weeks of relentless defense on Earth, the Dragance fleet stood ready to deploy, accompanied by the mighty Guardian. Their target: Feila, the desert planet and home of the formidable Oxiance. The desolate terrain offered little cover against the relentless xianimon defenders. The enemy seemed to possess an endless supply of ammunition, posing a formidable challenge for the Dragance forces.

However, the Oxiance, renowned for their exceptional craftsmanship, had developed high-resistance armor capable of deflecting the onslaught of the xianimons. This innovation provided a glimmer of hope for the Dragance alliance. Their plan hinged on securing the Oxiance's plasma core, which would allow the Guardian to land and eliminate the remaining xianimon forces.

But to access the plasma core, they first had to eradicate the xianimon nest hidden within the reactor facility. As the ground troops advanced, a chilling sight greeted them—a colossal xianian Centiskorch burrowed beneath the desert sands with incredible speed. Fear rippled through the ranks, and an urgent call for air support was made. Fortunately, the aerial units were already aloft, awaiting their comrades' distress signal. Swiftly, the troops were airlifted, narrowly escaping the resurfacing xianian Centiskorch.

As the Dragance forces regrouped, a scan of the area revealed a multitude of xianian Centiskorch lurking beneath the surface, ready to strike. Progress toward the Oxiance's plasma core was hindered, with the stealthy and relentless foes causing a significant challenge. Nightfall descended upon the desert, prompting the aircraft to glide silently through the skies, while the ground troops moved with utmost caution, evading detection.

Through a series of arduous and covert maneuvers, the Dragance soldiers finally reached the heart of Feila—the bustling capital market. The once vibrant metal products now rusted, and fresh food had succumbed to rot. Taking refuge within the abandoned market stalls, they cautiously regrouped, silently eliminating any remaining threats. Exhausted but determined, they awaited the arrival of dawn, gathering their strength for the trials that lay ahead.

With the arrival of the sunrise, the Dragance troops replenished their energy with a quick snack before embarking on their mission. Some soldiers sought shelter within the buildings, wary of the long-range snipers among the xianimon ranks. Meanwhile, others ascended to the highest vantage points, utilizing scout drones to survey the core facility. To their dismay, the scouts revealed the presence of xianian snipers, deadly marksmen capable of detecting and eliminating targets from afar.

Recognizing the danger posed by the snipers, the ground troops deferred to their aerial counterparts for support. A mobile eradicator, specially designed for this mission, was swiftly deployed by the air forces. As the Dragance forces charged forward, the distraction caused by the aircraft drew the attention of the xianimons, momentarily diverting their focus. The xianimons managed to bring down the aircraft, but their delayed realization came too late—their nest had been decimated.

With the path to the plasma core facility now clear, the Dragance alliance called upon the second Guardian to land. After a period of consolidation, the Guardian activated a portal, unleashing an unending stream of troops upon the planet's surface. The remaining objective was twofold: eliminate the formidable large xianimons and destroy the war beacon that served as a gateway to the planet Areoz.

Transforming the plasma core facility into a makeshift military base, the Dragance forces strategized on how to overcome the xianimon guarding the war beacon. However, a sudden onslaught of xianimons caught them off guard, prompting a state of high alert. Meanwhile, on Earth, the skilled mechanics of the Oxiance had constructed a specialized transport ship designed for troop deployment. The Dragance eagerly accepted this new asset, foreseeing its invaluable role in future endeavors.

Returning to Feila, the Dragance camp successfully weathered the onslaught, and they launched their offensive. However, a colossal armored xianimon emerged, shielding the nearby xianimons and the war beacon. The Dragance warriors momentarily forgot the increased strength and resilience of the xianimons in close proximity to the war beacon, posing a significant challenge. After careful planning and strategic thinking, a daring plan was conceived—to mimic the tactics of the xianian Centiskorch by burrowing underground and ambushing the enemy upon resurfacing.

Utilizing the leftover materials from the market, the Dragance engineers hastily constructed a sturdy machine capable of subterranean movement. With their new underground vehicle, they descended beneath the battlefield. After a tense period, the machine resurfaced, instantly capturing the attention of every xianimon present. Seizing the opportunity, the Dragance unleashed the fully charged mobile eradicator, its searing plasma projectiles neutralizing the smaller xianimons. However, the large xianimon remained defiant until a well-placed tactical nuke finally brought it down.

With the war beacon destroyed before reinforcements could arrive, the Dragance alliance erupted in celebration, reveling in their hard-fought victory. Even as Ahrazxia, witnessing her defeat from the planet Areoz, unleashed her fury with a resounding cry that echoed through the xianimon ranks, the victorious Dragance forces paid it no heed. On Earth, the joyous festivities continued, marking the successful restoration of the Oxiance homeworld. Now, their sights were set on the icy planet Icia, where the Actilance faction awaited their liberation.

As the fleet arrived on the icy planet Icia, also known as OGLE-2016-BLG-1190Lb, they faced a challenging situation. The thick and bitterly cold weather made it difficult for their scanners to properly map the planet's surface, hindering their ability to locate the war beacon and a safe landing spot for the Guardian and troops.

With no other option available, the Dragance deployed a large drone to the planet's surface to scout the area. However, the drone's vision was severely limited, only able to see up to 15 meters ahead due to the thick snow impeding its mobility. Despite the risks, the Dragance had no choice but to rely on the drone to provide critical information.

The Guardian carrier, commanded from above, landed blindly at the drone's location after its arrival. The freezing temperatures were already taking a toll on the drone's components, rendering it immobile and causing its camera to freeze and lose sight. Just before the drone's camera was entirely blocked, it detected movement in the distance and reported it to the Dragance.

As the Guardian reached the drone's location and opened the portal, the Actilance members, who had been waiting in the portal bay, felt the biting cold. The Dragance issued a warning for them to survey their surroundings carefully before proceeding on the mission. With no visibility due to the thick weather and GPS satellites unable to penetrate the icy atmosphere, the Actilance had to traverse the treacherous mountainous and snowy terrain blindly.

After hours of difficult travel, they heard the cry of xianimons echoing through the icy landscape. Alerted to the presence of a female ice-based xianimon, the Actilance troops hid, fearing an encounter with a formidable foe. Surprisingly, the xianimon did not display aggression but instead approached them curiously.

Unsure of how to react, the troops remained still, with one of them inadvertently making eye contact with the xianimon. To their astonishment, the xianimon licked their face affectionately, sparing their lives. The Dragance watching the spectacle were equally perplexed but quickly deduced that the xianimon was trying to communicate.

Following the Dragance's advice, the Actilance offered the xianimon a snack, which it happily devoured. The Actilance proceeded cautiously, but the xianimon playfully chased and hugged one of them, causing a brief delay. The Dragance instructed them to continue with the xianimon accompanying them on their mission.

During their blind journey, the Actilance encountered a wall, which they recognized as the outer perimeter of their icy fortress, now buried under the snow. As the xianimon directed their attention eastward, the Actilance initially ignored it. However, they eventually followed the xianimon's lead and split into two groups—one to recover the fortress and the other to investigate the eastern direction.

As the Actilance ventured eastward, their friendly xianimon companion directed their attention to a mysterious figure in the distance. Despite the thick weather obscuring their view, they could make out a blurred light emanating from the figure. Further analysis revealed that they had stumbled upon the war beacon, guarded by hordes of xianimons and a broken turret.

Meanwhile, the other team successfully restored power to the fortress and activated its defenses once again. However, unbeknownst to them, the broken turret near the first team unexpectedly powered on and began attacking the xianimons in its vicinity. This sudden display of aggression drew the attention of the nearby xianimons, who swiftly turned their focus towards the first team, now accompanied by their xianimon friend.

Alarmed and under attack, the Actilance teams found themselves facing an intensified battle as the legendary tale of their encounter with the xianimon and the war beacon unfolded. The clash between the courageous Actilance and the relentless xianimon forces became the stuff of sci-fi legend, forever etched in the annals of intergalactic lore.

United as one, the Actilance teams fought valiantly against the hordes of xianimons guarding the war beacon. With their weapons falling to pieces against the formidable foes, they called for reinforcements. The Dragance responded swiftly, deploying more Actilance soldiers through the portal along with a mobile eradicator mounted on a formidable metal Avalugg, increasing their firepower and maneuverability.

The earlier team, accompanied by their friendly xianimon, held their ground while awaiting support. The reinforcements arrived just in time, launching a daring aerial assault on the giant xianimon that guarded the war beacon. Though the aircraft was brought down, all the soldiers emerged unharmed. Simultaneously, the other team engaged the large xianimon with the mobile eradicator, but the thick weather provided the creature with an advantage, hiding it from sight and making it difficult to target.

Fortunately, the friendly xianimon once again proved invaluable, pointing out the location of the elusive giant. This allowed the mobile eradicator to charge up and take aim. With a powerful blast, it delivered a decisive blow, felling the massive xianimon in a single strike. The weakened war beacon, frozen by the frigid temperatures, was swiftly disabled, marking the Actilance's successful conquest of their third war beacon.

Back on Earth, Ahrazxia watched in fury as her third war beacon was dismantled. Enraged, she shattered the large television screen displaying the defeat, vowing to reclaim each territory and make the entire universe bow to her command. Meanwhile, the team from Icia, accompanied by their loyal xianimon friend, safely returned home. The Actilance expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Dragance for liberating their beloved planet.

With Icia now secure, the Dragance turned their attention to the next mission: retaking the planet Vial, which had fallen into the hands of the xians, originally belonging to the Creselians. The legends of the Actilance's heroic exploits and their ongoing battle against the xianimon horde spread far and wide, inspiring hope and resistance against Ahrazxia's tyrannical reign.
