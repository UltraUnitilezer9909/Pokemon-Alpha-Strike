# **Story**

Within the expansive depths of outer space, situated aboard a space station, the Pokémon inhabitants ingeniously engineered an artificial entity known as "Xianimon" with the purpose of attaining dominion over the entire universe. However, an unforeseen breach occurred, sparking a widespread conflict among various factions that collectively oppose the "Xianimon," identifying themselves as the "Xians."
