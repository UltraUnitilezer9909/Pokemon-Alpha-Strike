# **Story**

- ### **General Story**

> Once upon a time, in a bygone era, there existed a magnificent and ancient civilization known as **Areoxiaz**. This advanced society stood as a beacon of technological prowess, far surpassing anything imaginable in our present age. Within their realm, the intricacy of biological life In this world, **Pokémon** were absent, replaced by mystical beings known as **Xianimons**. These extraordinary creatures possessed complexity and capabilities that far exceeded those of the humble Pokémon. Their powers, communication, construction prowess, and way of existence were ethereal, transcending the understanding of ordinary beings.

> In the farthest reaches of the cosmos, nestled within the expansive and resplendent galaxy called **Ahzeos**, resided a planet known as **Areoz**. It was on this celestial body that the Xianimons called home, inhabiting its vibrant landscapes and shimmering vistas. Despite their invasive nature, these beings possessed a pearl of innate wisdom, discerning which realms to embrace and which to leave untouched. Unlike the flawed tendencies of Pokémon nature, Xianimons embodied a harmony and purity rarely found among sentient beings. Every individual, regardless of wealth, strength, skill, or talent, was treated with equality and respect. The essence of compassion and selflessness coursed through the veins of their society, extending a helping hand to all in need, even beyond the borders of their beloved Areoz.

> Guiding and safeguarding the cherished realm of Areoz were nine revered guardians, whose names resonated throughout the annals of time. **Artriazel**, the Crystal Warrior, manifested as a spirit akin to the indomitable Bisharp. **Xherhezius**, the Soul Keeper, soared with the presence of a majestic Mandibuzz. **Ahzalia**, the Caretaker of Nature, emanated a gentle yet captivating aura reminiscent of the enchanting Mawile. **Sharehpia**, the Mistress of Time, possessed a spirit resonating with the grace and elegance of Primarina. **Quzheril**, the Tempered Ninja, embodied the stealth and agility of a formidable Breloom. **Kathaleo**, the Aggressive Templar, commanded authority with a spirit akin to the noble Bayleef.

> Among the guardians, two ethereal figures held a unique place in the tapestry of Areoz. **Rhozelina** and **Zhereo**, the Princess and Prince of Illusion and Love, manifested as enchanting Ninetales and enigmatic Zoroark, respectively. Their love and symbiotic bond formed a protective barrier against darkness, shielding the very fabric of their world. **Exiaos**, the Mighty Metal Dragon, roared with a presence reminiscent of the indomitable Duraludon, exuding an aura of invincibility. Finally, the embodiment of unparalleled power and command, **Ahraxhezrix**, reigned supreme among the guardians. This celestial entity harnessed the spirit of the legendary Rayquaza, wielding its might with an awe-inspiring grace.

> Alas, the echoes of destiny reverberated through the halls of time, signalling a cataclysmic turning point. The day arrived when the nine guardians, seduced by the allure of their power, succumbed to a malevolent force lurking in the shadows. Their spirits tainted, they unleashed devastation upon the world they were sworn to protect. Chaos erupted, lives were shattered, and innocent Xianimons perished, their light snuffed out in an unyielding tempest of darkness.

> In the wake of this unimaginable tragedy, the resilient survivors of Areoz came together, united by a shared determination to preserve their fading legacy. They harnessed their collective wisdom and crafted a relic of unimaginable power—**the Crystal Relic Stone**. This crystalline artefact possessed the ability to confine the wayward guardians, binding their malevolence within its unyielding embrace. The Stone, an enduring symbol of hope and resilience, was entrusted to the guardians of a hidden vault, ensuring its eternal safekeeping. No key, no incantation, nor mortal hands would unlock its formidable seal, safeguarding the world from the resurgence of darkness.

> Though the guardians' cataclysm unleashed devastation, obliterating the remaining survivors and reducing their cherished habitat to ruin, fragments of their existence persist to this day. Transcending the bounds of mortal perception, they exist within an *ethereal dimension*, veiled from ordinary sight. And so, the tale of Areoxiaz and the noble Xianimons, the fallen guardians, and the indomitable survivors lives on, whispered in hushed tones as an enduring legend of a civilization lost in time.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

> Many aeons passed, and the legend of Areoxiaz endured, resonating through the corridors of time. Its ethereal echoes reached the ears of intrepid scientists, captivated by the allure of the mythical civilization. Driven by insatiable curiosity, they embarked on a daring expedition, venturing across the vastness of space to uncover the truth behind the ancient tale.

> Guided by the whispers of the legend, the scientists journeyed to the fabled planet of Areoz, armed with awe-inspiring advancements in language and technology. Days turned into nights as they meticulously scoured the cosmic landscapes, following the path laid out by the ancient lore. And there, amidst the cosmic tapestry, they discovered the vault, a testament to the enduring power of the Crystal Relic Stone.

> With trembling hands and beating hearts, they ventured deeper, unlocking the vault's sacred chamber. The brilliance of the Crystal Relic Stone bathed the room in a mesmerizing glow, revealing secrets veiled by the annals of time. It was a moment of triumph and trepidation, for within their grasp lay the power to reshape destiny itself.

> Yet, fate can be capricious, and the scientists unknowingly erred. In their pursuit of knowledge, a catastrophic mistake unfolded. Through a misguided act, the relic was inadvertently disassembled, shattering the fragile prison that held the malevolent guardians at bay. In an instant, the legends transformed into horrifying reality. The unleashed guardians, consumed by their dark intentions, embarked upon a merciless rampage. Death and destruction blanketed the once-hallowed space station as alarms blared, piercing the frigid silence. The urgent cry of impending doom echoed through the steel corridors, urging all within to evacuate the crumbling sanctuary.

> The station, a sanctuary once inhabited by Pokémon, became a battleground of desperation. As the inhabitants fought for survival, their chances dwindled with every passing moment. Only a few managed to escape the relentless onslaught, among them the protagonist and their stalwart companions, united by destiny's relentless pull. Amidst the chaos, eight additional spirits emerged from the shattered fragments of the Crystal Relic Stone. These ethereal entities, brimming with ancient wisdom, converged in a profound conversation. They forged a solemn pact, vowing to seek out **the chosen eight** destined to stand against the unleashed guardians and avert the looming universal catastrophe.

> Days turned into nights as the spirits guided the remaining survivors in their search for "the chosen eight." Through treacherous landscapes and perilous trials, they navigated the uncharted realms, their every step fraught with uncertainty. Finally, after an arduous journey, they stood before the chosen ones, the convergence of mortal and ethereal destinies.

> With solemn voices, the spirits imparted upon them the weight of their sacred task – to stand as beacons of hope and wielders of ancient power. The chosen ones, driven by a resolute purpose, accepted the mantle of champions, their hearts burning with courage.

> And so, the stage was set for an epic confrontation, where the chosen eight, guided by the ethereal spirits, would face the unleashed guardians. The fate of the universe hung in the balance, and the legends of Areoxiaz would forever be inscribed in the annals of time, as the chosen ones embarked on their perilous quest to preserve existence itself.

> In the final throes of their perilous quest, guided by the ethereal spirits, the protagonist bravely confronted the unleashed guardians. One by one, they engaged in fierce battles, harnessing their newfound strength to overpower the malevolent forces that threatened existence. Across dimensions and through the deepest recesses of galaxies, the chosen eight embarked on their relentless journey.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

> The fateful day arrived when the eight spirits and the chosen heroes converged, united by the pieces of the shattered Crystal Relic Stone. With each fragment, they captured the guardians one by one, their power slowly dwindling. Only one remained, the mighty Ahraxhezrix, whose heart remained hardened against the pleas and reasoning of the chosen eight. What started as a gentle conversation turned into a tempest of anger and defiance.

> Undeterred, the heroes pressed on, searching for the final guardian while grappling with their own exhaustion. And then, destiny wove its threads once more, as the fateful encounter between the heroes and the ninth guardian finally transpired. As the eight heroes prepared for an arduous battle, Ahraxhezrix unleashed a game-changing move, whisking them away to a strange and otherworldly dimension.

> In a shocking turn of events, Ahraxhezrix revived the eight fallen guardians, imbuing them with even greater power. The heroes, unprepared for this unexpected twist, fought valiantly but found themselves outmatched. Battle after battle ensued, and one by one, the guardians they had previously conquered fell under the relentless assault.

> Ultimately, only two heroes remained standing, while the other six were forced to retreat and regroup. It was a grueling 2-on-1 battle against the indomitable Ahraxhezrix. As the heroes engaged in a brief conversation, desperately seeking understanding, their words fell on deaf ears. Ahraxhezrix's anger surged, and the clash of epic proportions began.

> Move after move, the heroes fought valiantly, but their strength waned as the ninth guardian grew stronger with each passing moment. The heroes found themselves on the brink of despair, their only recourse to escape. As they fled, one of the heroes stumbled, and to their horror, Ahraxhezrix closed in, preparing a devastating attack. But just as hope seemed lost, a mysterious portal materialized.

> Awe-struck and bewildered, Ahraxhezrix froze in disbelief as an explosive surprise unfurled before their eyes. From the portal emerged the Xianimons, riding a marvel of advanced technology. They rushed to the aid of the two heroes, and a monumental battle against Ahraxhezrix ensued. Shots rang out, blades clashed, and the final threat faced its demise. Ahraxhezrix's laughter turned into weakness, as the heroes, together with the Xianimons, sealed the guardian's power within the restored relic.

> Expressing their heartfelt gratitude, the heroes thanked the Xianimons for saving their lives, and in turn, the Xianimons conveyed their appreciation. The relic, fragile and unstable, was returned to its secure vault, now heavily guarded. The monsters trapped within slumbered, their energies dormant until the relic's demise.

> Peace was restored to the land, and a harmonious friendship blossomed between Pokémon and Xianimons. The relic, a reminder of the battles fought and the unity forged, remained protected within the vault. Life carried on, and the heroes returned to their homes, their hearts filled with gratitude for the Xianimons' intervention.

> And so, an era of tranquility was ushered in, as Pokémon and Xianimons coexisted in harmony. The relic, a silent witness to the legends and adventures that unfolded, served as a constant reminder of the precarious balance between darkness and light. Legends would forever recount the epic tale of the chosen eight, the valiant Xianimons, and the fateful battle that shaped the destiny of their intertwined worlds.

> And so, as peace settled upon the land and joy filled the hearts of Pokémon and Xianimons alike, a sense of curiosity and wonder swept through the universe. While the heroes had triumphed over the malevolent guardians and restored harmony, the vast expanse of the cosmos remained uncharted and shrouded in mystery.

> Whispers echoed among the stars, tales of untold wonders and hidden dangers lurking in the depths of the universe. Eager explorers yearned to unveil the secrets that lay beyond, their insatiable thirst for knowledge pushing them further into the unknown. For in the realm of legends, where light and darkness danced their eternal dance, the concept of balance remained steadfast.

> Some pondered if a greater evil awaited, a force more formidable than the guardians that once threatened existence. Others held onto the hope that the exploration of the universe would unveil boundless opportunities for unity and peace. Yet, in the realm of legends, it was known that where good prospered, the ever-present shadow of evil would linger.

> Whichever path the universe would ultimately tread, the tale of the chosen eight and their courageous stand against the unleashed guardians would be etched into the tapestry of time. The legend would continue to inspire future generations, urging them to embrace unity, honor, and the indomitable spirit of heroism.

> As the universe beckoned with its uncharted territories, the brave and the curious would rise to the call. Their journeys would carve new legends and shape the fate of worlds yet undiscovered. For in the vast cosmic expanse, where stars collided and galaxies converged, the eternal battle between darkness and light would forever unfold.

> And so, the legend remained unfinished, an open invitation to all who sought to chart the depths of the universe. As heroes emerged and new tales unfurled, the legacy of the chosen eight lived on, reminding all who heard of the indomitable power of unity, courage, and the unyielding human spirit.

> For the universe was a canvas awaiting the strokes of destiny, an ever-evolving saga where the boundaries of possibility were yet to be defined. And in that great cosmic symphony, where good and evil danced their eternal waltz, the stage was set for new legends to be born, propelling the universe forward in an everlasting quest for balance and transcendence.

> Thus, the tale remains untold, awaiting the time when new heroes would rise and the pages of the legend would continue to be written. Until then, the universe brims with anticipation, holding its breath for the next chapter of the eternal legend to unfold.
