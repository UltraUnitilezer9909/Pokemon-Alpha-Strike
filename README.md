However, there is a breach in the sectobase's laboratory at the end, where a artificial Pokémon called "Arxiarus" breaks free from its container. Due to exposure to radiation from space and other substances in the lab, the it mutates into a Rayquaza-like Pokémon. It manages to escape by forcefully breaking through the thick walls made of "Titenomiunel" (a combination of titanium, tungsten, chromium, and Inconel). The breach causes the Sectobase to depressurize, and the Rayquaza-like Pokémon escapes undetected into the vast depths of space. During the escape, most Pokémon are sucked out into space, while the others are aboard the evacuation ship. But the Player and its friends are separated from the evacuation, drove to the nearest abounded Sectobase becausethey dont have enough fuel to go on an active Sectobase leading to the [next chapter](https://github.com/UltraUnitilezer9909/Pokemon-Alpha-Strike#chapter-2-where-all-things-started)
